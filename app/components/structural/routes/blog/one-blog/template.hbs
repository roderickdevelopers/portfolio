        <p>Yes, freeCodeCamp was the beginning for me, and I highly recommend it to anyone new to coding that wants to
          learn and
          feel accomplished after each lesson. I got my Certificate for Responsive Web Design, JavaScript Algorithms and
          Data
          Structures, and Front End Libraries. I will continue my learning with freeCodeCamp and my internship at Design
          Monster,
          and I know with hard work and dedication, more opportunities will come my way! Check out <a
            href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a>. You can learn
          HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and much more.
