    <p>Yes freeCodeCamp was the beginning for me and I highly recommend it to any new coders that want to learn and feel
      accomplished after each lesson. I got my Certificate for Responsive Web Design and my
      JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structure Certificate now. I will continue my learning with freeCodeCamp as well as my internship at Design Monster
      and I know with hard work and dedication more opportunities will come my way! My goal is to finish all the courses.
      Check out <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a>, you can learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and much
      more.
